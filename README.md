For description we will use quill wysiwyg text editor which comes with almost all of Microsoft word features for text editing. We can change the size of text and add images, videos and iframes to description. Each Post will have a description( uses quill text editor) and a few files. Bucket will contain all files required for class. Conferencing helps students to join video conferencing(jitsi meet). I have integrated jitsi meet(an open source project ) with our application for conferencing.
